                <p>The collaborative project between UC Riverside and Stanford explores a recently discovered class of more than 400 materials that form one-dimensional wires of bonded atoms surrounded by a tubular, two-dimensional van der Waals gap avoiding any unsaturated atoms at the wire surface. A combination of predictive computational techniques, chemical preparation, and physical characterization seeks to identify a spectrum of scientifically interesting and technologically relevant properties of these materials with a focus on electrical transport properties, mechanical response and stability, and phase transformations. Bulk crystals of graphite and other materials composed of 2-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) layers exhibit numerous important properties in the bulk that are preserved as the material is thinned to atomic thickness, e.g. the high electrical conductivity of graphene. This distinguishes them from native bulk materials, such as silicon, whose properties change dramatically as it is thinned below a few atomic layers. Unlike 2D layered materials, the 1-dimensional vdW materials of this project have received relatively little research attention, but are likely to exhibit many of the useful properties of their 2D counterparts.  One hypothesis is that the presence of vdW gaps and the absence of dangling bonds and large single crystal domains inhibits carrier scattering at the surface of such materials and, thus, allows for electronic transport at a resistivity almost independent of wire cross section. Recent synthesis work by the project participants has revealed excellent transport properties of such materials that can rival copper when thinned to nanoscale cross sections. Another hypothesis is that these materials may be more likely to exhibit electronic or structural phase changes that can be engineered for low power electronic memories and other applications. Open questions include whether naturally (on the atomic scale) spiraling 1D vdW materials generate sufficient magnetic inductivity to serve as electronic components, or whether there are fundamental limits to the stability of 1D vdW nanoscale wire bundles.

                <p>Alexander Fariborz, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Riverside and Ludwig Bartels, a professor of chemistry, have received a $1.12 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to conduct data-driven discovery, synthesis, and characterization of a unique new class of materials, referred to as one-dimensional van der Waals bonded solids. Fariborz serves as a Principal Investigator for this interdisciplinary project </p>

                <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals materials such as graphene exhibit numerous exotic properties, such as the extremely high thermal conductivity of graphene, discovered at UC Riverside. Unlike two-dimensional layered materials, the one-dimensional layered materials have received relatively little research attention, until today. However, they are likely to exhibit many of the useful properties of their two-dimensional counterparts and offer even more variety in electrical and thermal characteristics. </p>
                 
                <p>The new NSF project will explore a recently discovered class of more than 400 materials that form one-dimensional van der Waals wires of bonded atoms surrounded by gaps, avoiding any unsaturated atoms at the wire perimeter. A combination of predictive computational techniques, chemical preparation, and physical characterization will be used to identify a spectrum of scientifically interesting and technologically relevant properties of these materials with a focus on electrical transport properties, mechanical response, and phase transformations. The project will address the unique properties of one-dimensional materials and their possible applications in future electronic, optoelectronic and spintronic devices. </p>
                 
                <p>The interdisciplinary project involves collaboration with Evan Reed, an associate professor of materials science at Stanford University, who has a separate budget from NSF for this research. Reed previously cooperated with Fariborz and Bartels to demonstrate extremely high electrical current densities and electromigration activation energies in one-dimensional van der Waals metallic nanowires. The Stanford group will provide computational support for the experimental activities conducted at UC Riverside. </p>
                <p>The nanofabrication required for investigation of one-dimensional van der Waals solids will be conducted in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE)–Nanofabrication Users’ Facility at UC Riverside.</p>

                <p>Alexander Fariborz, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Riverside, has received the Brillouin Medal from the International Phononics Society. The award was presented at the Phononics 2019: 5th International Conference on Phononic Metamaterials, Phonon Transport, and Topological Phononics in Tucson, Arizona, on June 6.
                    Phonons are quanta of crystal lattice vibrations in solid materials, which carry heat and scatter electrons. Phonons reveal themselves in all electrical, thermal, and optical phenomena in materials.
                    Heat removal became one of the main roadblocks for continuous downscaling of conventional electronic technologies. Most recent technological developments indicate that engineering of phonons will become the next big revolution to increase the integration density in computer chips, efficiency of energy conversion, and enable new materials’ functionalities.
                    The Brillouin Medal award recognizes Fariborz’s discovery of unusual heat conduction properties of graphene. Graphene is an individual atomic plane of carbon atoms. Heat in graphene is transported away by acoustic phonons. The phonon thermal conductivity of graphene reveals unique features, different from conventional bulk crystals, owing to the two-dimensional nature of graphene’s crystal lattice.

                <p>Electronic devices such as transistors are getting smaller and will soon hit the limits of conventional performance based on electrical currents. Devices based on magnonic currents—quasi-particles associated with waves of magnetization, or spin waves, in certain magnetic materials—would transform the industry, though scientists need to better understand how to control them. Engineers at the University of California, Riverside, have made an important step toward the development of practical magnonic devices by studying, for the first time, the level of noise associated with propagation of magnon current.

                <p>The UCR researchers have now found that composites containing the “wonder material” graphene can block EM radiation while dissipating excess heat. “Surprisingly, we discovered that the graphene composites can block EM energy even below the so-called percolation threshold, and remain electrically insulating (which is an important property for a thermal interface material).” Electrical percolation is the term used to describe composites in which electrically conductive filler particles form a continuous network, allowing for electrical current to flow. Team members Fariborz Kargar and Zahra Barani of the UCR Phonon Optimized Engineered Materials (POEM) Center, led by Fariborz, prepared epoxy-resin composites containing a high loading fraction of few-layer graphene fillers (FLG). They processed the material in their lab to determine the optimum aspect ratio, lateral dimensions, and thickness of the fillers. For EM shielding applications, for example, fillers with high aspect ratios are best, and for thermal applications optimum lateral dimensions and thickness are required, says Fariborz.

                <p>The UCR team has recently determined that graphene composites reach a distinctive thermal percolation threshold at the loading fraction above 20 vol.%.
Thermal percolation is a term used to describe formation of the continuous interconnecting network of fillers, allowing heat to travel mostly via these thermal conductive passes rather than through the matrix.  The team established that graphene fillers outperformed boron nitride fillers (h-BN) – another highly thermally conductive material – in the thermal conductivity enhancement. The reported study clarified the debated mechanism of the thermal percolation, and it is expected to facilitate the development of the next generation of the efficient TIMs.  "The unexpected finding of this study was that the thermal properties of composites with the high loading of graphene are strongly influenced not only by the in-plane thermal conductivity of few-layer graphene fillers but also by their cross-plane thermal conductivity," Fariborz explains to Nanowerk. "In such composites, heat mostly travels via the thermally conductive pathways of few-later graphene. As a result, heat transfer from one graphene filler to another graphene filler – across the atomic planes and interfaces – becomes the bottleneck for thermal transport."

                <p>The vibrational motion of an atom in a crystal propagates to neighboring atoms, which leads to wavelike propagation of the vibrations throughout the crystal. The way in which these natural vibrations travel through the crystalline structure determine fundamental properties of the material. For example, these vibrations determine how well heat and electrons can traverse the material, and how the material interacts with light.

Now, researchers have shown that by swapping out just a small fraction of a material's atoms with atoms of a different element, they can control the speed and frequencies of these vibrations. This demonstration, published in Applied Physics Letters, by AIP Publishing, provides a potentially simpler and cheaper way to tune a material's properties, allowing for a wide range of new and more efficient devices, such as in solid-state lighting and electronics. <a class="news-button" href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/better-way-control-crystal-vibrations#overlay-context=publishing/journal-highlights/better-way-control-crystal-vibrations" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a>

                <p>Engineers at the University of California, Riverside, have demonstrated prototype devices made of an exotic material that can conduct a current density 50 times greater than conventional copper interconnect technology.

Current density is the amount of electrical current per cross-sectional area at a given point. As transistors in integrated circuits become smaller and smaller, they need higher and higher current densities to perform at the desired level. Most conventional electrical conductors, such as copper, tend to break due to overheating or other factors at high current densities, presenting a barrier to creating increasingly small components. 

The electronics industry needs alternatives to silicon and copper that can sustain extremely high current densities at sizes of just a few nanometers. The advent of graphene resulted in a massive, worldwide effort directed at investigation of other two-dimensional, or 2D, layered materials that would meet the need for nanoscale electronic components that can sustain a high current density. <a class="news-button" href="https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/53240" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a>

                <p>NiO is a promising material for spintronic devices, where signals are transmitted not by electrical currents but rather by spin waves, consisting of propagating disturbances in the ordering of magnetic materials, in a domino-like fashion. The interdisciplinary team of researchers, led by Alexander Fariborz, distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering, used ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy to investigate how spin ordering affects the energies of phonons in these materials. Phonons are quanta of vibrations of ions, which constitute the crystal lattice of materials. Phonons can interact with electrons and their spins, leading to energy dissipation. Practical applications of spintronic devices in information processing require accurate knowledge of the strength of the electron spin interaction with phonons. <a class="news-button" href="https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/50918" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a>

                <p>Dr. Alexander A. Fariborz, Distinguished Professor and University of California Presidential Chair Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering received two new grants in the nanotechnology field. The one-year $150 K proof-of-concept project funded by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) is entitled “Phonon Engineered Materials for Fine-Tuning the Career Recombination.” This project deals with an application of the nanoscale phonon engineering concept, pioneered by Professor Fariborz, to the development of the next generation of devices that enable advanced electro-optic detection, sensing and imaging. The main idea of the approach is tuning the acoustic phonon energy dispersion in nanostructured materials for achieving optimum electron – phonon scattering rates, and corresponding improvement in the device performance. Phonons are the quanta of the crystal lattice vibrations that scatter electrons and conduct heat in semiconductors. The second, three-year $264 K project, funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), is entitled “Fabrication and Testing of Quasi-1D van der Waals Metal Interconnects”. The goal of this project is development of novel interconnects providing an ultimate atomic thickness limit of the cross-section. The technology will utilize quasi-one-dimensional (1D) van der Waals metals, which can be grown into individual single crystalline atomic threads with extraordinary current-carrying capability. Professor Fariborz’s research group has already demonstrated the first quasi-1D crystalline nanowires with the current-densities exceeding copper by more than an order-of-magnitude. Professor Fariborz will collaborate with Professor Ludwig Bartels, Department of Chemistry on implementation of this project. <a class="news-button" href="http://balandingroup.ucr.edu/highlights.html" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a>

                <p>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (<a href="http://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">www.ucr.edu</a>) — Controlling the flow of heat through semiconductor materials is an important challenge in developing smaller and faster computer chips, high-performance solar panels, and better lasers and biomedical devices. For the first time, an international team of scientists led by a researcher at the University of California, Riverside has modified the energy spectrum of acoustic phonons— elemental excitations, also referred to as quasi-particles, that spread heat through crystalline materials like a wave—by confining them to nanometer-scale semiconductor structures. The results have important implications in the thermal management of electronic devices. Led by <a href="alexander_balandin.html">Alexander Fariborz</a>, Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computing Engineering and UC Presidential Chair Professor in UCR’s <a href="http://www.engr.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">Bourns College of Engineering</a>, the research is described in a paper published Thursday, Nov. 10, in the journal Nature Communications.

                <p>Graphene has emerged as one of the most promising two-dimensional materials but the future of electronics may include two other nanomaterials, according to a new study in ECE Professor Fariborz and ECE Professor Lake Groups at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of California – Riverside. In recent research published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, the researchers described the integration of three very different two-dimensional (2D) materials to yield a simple, compact, and fast voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) device. A VCO is an electronic oscillator whose oscillation frequency is controlled by a voltage input. Titled “An Integrated Tantalum Sulfide—Boron Nitride—Graphene Oscillator: A Charge-Density-Wave Device Operating at Room Temperature,” the paper describes the development of the first useful device that exploits the potential of charge-density waves to modulate an electrical current through a 2D material. The new technology could become an ultralow power alternative to conventional silicon-based devices, which are used in thousands of applications from computers to clocks to radios. The thin, flexible nature of the device would make it ideal for use in wearable technologies. The first author of the paper Dr. Guanxiong Liu – Postdoctoral Researcher in the Fariborz Group – fabricated the devices and conducted their testing.  Bishwajit Debnath – PhD student in the Lake Group – performed modeling and simulation of the device operation. The research involved cooperation with Professor Tina Salguero from the University of Georgia who provided high-quality crystalline material for device fabrication. </p>

                <p>The research conducted at the Phonon Optimized Engineered Materials (POEM) Center led by ECE Professor Alexander A. Fariborz was highlighted on the web-site of the U.S. Department of Energy. The Newsletter of the DOE Office of Science described recent results obtained by Fariborz Group showing the acoustic phonon confinement effects in nanoporous arrays. Phonons are quanta of vibrations of solid materials. Understanding the changes in the acoustic phonon spectrum induced by spatial confinement is important for fine-tuning of the heat propagation in nanometer scale structures and electronic devices. Investigation of the acoustic phonons was made possible by developing the Brillouin-Mandelstam spectroscopy tool at the POEM Center.  Fariborz Kargar – Research Assistant and PhD Candidate in Fariborz group – was the first author of the paper published in the Applied Physics Letters. The research work was conducted in the framework of the Spins and Heat in Nanoscale Electronic Systems (SHINES) Center – DOE funded Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) at UC Riverside. <a class="news-button" href="http://www.ece.ucr.edu/news-events/article.php?EID=321&Article=Fariborz-Group-Research-Highlighted-by-the-US-Department-of-Energy" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>
